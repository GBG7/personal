						Satec Presented me with unprecedented opportunities and chances for success. The lessons I learnt there, as well as my experience there is something that will stick with me for a long, long time.
						<br><br> My participation in clubs and school related activities have taught me a significant amount. Volunteering my time in order to help my robotics club run their district wide competition had taught me the attention to small details required for success. My in class experience hammered in the importance of hard works, strong morals, and never giving up.  My time spent as executives of multiple clubs has shown me the amount of work required just to take a step forward and not collapse. The importance of grades, marks, and having proper work ethics in order to succeed was also something I learnt throughout my tenure at Satec.
						<br><br> 
						Whilst I did endure difficult times and had dealt with failure more often than I wanted to, i'm truly grateful for these 4 years in highschool. What I learnt will go on to be beneficial to be even 40 years from now. Many people look back as high school as one of the worst, most awkward, and difficult times. However, I see it as a time where I learnt the most about myself and the world around me. I believe that the lessons I learnt are going to be of the utmost importance throughout university, my career, and my social life. For that, I have to say, fuck you satec! :)

					<h3><b>Satec Astro WebDev Exec</b></h3>
					<p style="color:#89a227"><i>2021 - Present </i></p>
					<p class ="">
						Being a member of the satec astro club, and later becoming an executive for the web dev position was a dream... 
						<br><br> 
						As a kid, my interest in outer space and astronomy was insatiable. It started off with my curiosity about aliens & extraterrestrial beings, before slowly falling into absolute awe at size of the universe we lived in, the existence of the objects, and finally, our humble abode we live in called Mother Earth.
						<br><br>
						 I remember in middle school, an astronomer who worked in the CSA came to our school for a little QNA session. During that session, I asked so many questions, participated so much, and was just exuberating at the idea of being able to talk about astronomy this much. 
						<br><br>
						In fact, at the end of the session, a teacher who was supervising was so impressed with my enthusiasm and interest, that she ended up giving me a few posters, a little solar system model and space keychains. They were all technically school supplies, so she had me sneak them out in the backpack. When I asked her why she did it, she told me she wanted to support a young astronaut. (And that they were going to throw those things away. She really didn't like waste.)
						<br><br> 
						I had been presented a chance to mix my skills in computers and programming with my childhood passion of astronomy and space. For me, it was the perfect job.

							<li><i> Hosted zoom meets, planned events, activities and much more for online and in-person meetings. With the help of fellow club members & friends, I organized events and lead efforts to make them possible. </i></li>
							<li><i> Participated in STARCHASERS. A tdsb wide event with multiple different highschools participating was held during the spring of 2022. During this event, each school was to prepare a presentation regarding a space-related topic of their choice. I was a part of a group of 4 sent to represent Satec at the event.</i>aqz</li>

					<p>For comp eng in Mr. Breault's class, My group of 5 were tasked with a project of building a Hoverboard by utilising Arduino. <br><br> Fahim helped me with the IR remote code, Monti with the servo code, & Fiaz + Jeeya worked on building the actual model. I managed to code essentially everything else (except servo & IR) <br><br> Afterwards, we set our sights to making a "sailboat" version. Whilst we succeeded, due to time constraints, we couldn't implement it irl. <br><br>
					This hoverboard project was what led me to falling in love with robotics. This project let me go wild and allowed me to find true passion for IoT, and robotics. :D </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title">Javascript<br> Rock Paper Scissors</p>
					<p> During the beginning of the pandemic (2020), I (14M) delved deep into programming with Javascript. However, I had to learn the language through online resources. Classes were limited and with the new pandemic, I couldn't exactly take courses. However, Sal Khan came to my rescue. <br><br> The RPS game is fully animated by me, with no modules or libraries used. User first has to agree to "terms and conditions" before playing the game. <br> User is given 4 weapons to choose from (rock, paper, scissors, knife). When they choose, an AI is coded to choose one of those 4 weapons randomly. A score counter is set up. <br><br> A feature I really struggled with adding was the hidden gun. On the top right (left?) of the screen, there's up n down arrows that "scroll" the screen down  to reveal a gun that can beat all other weapons. It took me forever to add that feature, especially with how noob I was at coding. <br><br> The game's code is really shit. It's really inefficient and just too long to be viable. But for 14 year old me, it was the most enjoyable project i've worked on. I probably spend like a month making it without giving up. </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title">Cube Collection Program</p>
					<p> For school, we were given an assignment that utilized files and directories. We had to create an application that accepts a collector'ss information about a collectible. <br>The application should manage 3 or 4 bits of data per item. The application should allow the user to perform at least <br>
						2 actions:<br>
						i) enter information for a new item and save it<br>
						ii) your choice of action on the stored information. <br><br>
					What I had done was have the program accept, sorts, and visualizes collectable rubiks cubes. User is given an entry field where they can type enter to enter information about the cube. User can type search to search for a specific rubiks cube using an entered name. Program will then list the list holding the cube. User can type draw, and is prompted to enter dimensions of cube. Program will then open tkinter and draw a 2d version of said cube. <br><br> The programming of the code was not too difficult, until I came to the drawing section. Tkinter did not like me, and it was evident with the problems I was encountering. <br><br> The drawing of the cube itself on a 2d scale by using the size of the cube required some wits. The program would store the size of the cube that the user entered (i.e 3x3) on a text file. I had the program read the first character of the cube size stored fron the text file, then do bunch of complicated maths using that number. User couldn't enter non-cube rubiks cube (i.e 3x4 isn't a rubiks cube), so there was no way the program could draw the wrong 2d cube.  </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title"> Ripley's Aquarium Website </p>
					<p> In 2017, I was in grade 7. I was 12 years old at the time. During my academic year in grade 7, we had a class field trip to Ripelys Aquarium, where I took plenty of shitty pictures and lost $10 (still fucking furious about that). After all was said and done, our teacher gave us this fucking project where we had to make a brochure, advertising Ripleys Aquarium. <br><br>My over-achieveing head ass (jk) decide to make a website basically mimik in the real site. On the site, there's a little table containing entry prices, and a big title. There's a big banner with options like "Contact Us" linking to the real contact info. The site was hosted on Github<br><br> Credit where credit is due, I had tons of help from an online friend named Lucifer/Luci (irl name Ethan). Dude was a uni student studying software engineering, and basically gave me the idea for the website. I made the entire coede myself, but I'd be lying if I say he didn't help me. He basically was a sort of teacher, who led me to solutions regarding coding errors without solving it himself. <br><br> <i>I'm basically adding this because I want to flex that I did website building when I was 12. </i></p>
