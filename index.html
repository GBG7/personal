						Satec Presented me with unprecedented opportunities and chances for success. The lessons I learnt there, as well as my experience there is something that will stick with me for a long, long time.
						<br><br> My participation in clubs and school related activities have taught me a significant amount. Volunteering my time in order to help my robotics club run their district wide competition had taught me the attention to small details required for success. My in class experience hammered in the importance of hard works, strong morals, and never giving up.  My time spent as executives of multiple clubs has shown me the amount of work required just to take a step forward and not collapse. The importance of grades, marks, and having proper work ethics in order to succeed was also something I learnt throughout my tenure at Satec.
						<br><br> 
						Whilst I did endure difficult times and had dealt with failure more often than I wanted to, i'm truly grateful for these 4 years in highschool. What I learnt will go on to be beneficial to be even 40 years from now. Many people look back as high school as one of the worst, most awkward, and difficult times. However, I see it as a time where I learnt the most about myself and the world around me. I believe that the lessons I learnt are going to be of the utmost importance throughout university, my career, and my social life. For that, I have to say, fuck you satec! :)

					<h3><b>Satec Astro WebDev Exec</b></h3>
					<p style="color:#89a227"><i>2021 - Present </i></p>
					<p class ="">
						Being a member of the satec astro club, and later becoming an executive for the web dev position was a dream... 
						<br><br> 
						As a kid, my interest in outer space and astronomy was insatiable. It started off with my curiosity about aliens & extraterrestrial beings, before slowly falling into absolute awe at size of the universe we lived in, the existence of the objects, and finally, our humble abode we live in called Mother Earth.
						<br><br>
						 I remember in middle school, an astronomer who worked in the CSA came to our school for a little QNA session. During that session, I asked so many questions, participated so much, and was just exuberating at the idea of being able to talk about astronomy this much. 
						<br><br>
						In fact, at the end of the session, a teacher who was supervising was so impressed with my enthusiasm and interest, that she ended up giving me a few posters, a little solar system model and space keychains. They were all technically school supplies, so she had me sneak them out in the backpack. When I asked her why she did it, she told me she wanted to support a young astronaut. (And that they were going to throw those things away. She really didn't like waste.)
						<br><br> 
						I had been presented a chance to mix my skills in computers and programming with my childhood passion of astronomy and space. For me, it was the perfect job.

						Giving time outside of school is imperative to the development of one as a person. This means that giving charity (via your money, or time) will lead to one's moral and ethic development in a beneficial way. 
						<br><br>
						Which is why I volunteered wherever my time was needed. Often times, I'd volunteer simply because I wanted to help my wonderful community. Oftentimes, I put myself in harms way by simply volunteering my time.
