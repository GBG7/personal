						Satec Presented me with unprecedented opportunities and chances for success. The lessons I learnt there, as well as my experience there is something that will stick with me for a long, long time.
						<br><br> My participation in clubs and school related activities have taught me a significant amount. Volunteering my time in order to help my robotics club run their district wide competition had taught me the attention to small details required for success. My in class experience hammered in the importance of hard works, strong morals, and never giving up.  My time spent as executives of multiple clubs has shown me the amount of work required just to take a step forward and not collapse. The importance of grades, marks, and having proper work ethics in order to succeed was also something I learnt throughout my tenure at Satec.
						<br><br> 
						Whilst I did endure difficult times and had dealt with failure more often than I wanted to, i'm truly grateful for these 4 years in highschool. What I learnt will go on to be beneficial to be even 40 years from now. Many people look back as high school as one of the worst, most awkward, and difficult times. However, I see it as a time where I learnt the most about myself and the world around me. I believe that the lessons I learnt are going to be of the utmost importance throughout university, my career, and my social life. For that, I have to say, fuck you satec! :)

					<h3><b>Satec Astro WebDev Exec</b></h3>
					<p style="color:#89a227"><i>2021 - Present </i></p>
					<p class ="">
						Being a member of the satec astro club, and later becoming an executive for the web dev position was a dream... 
						<br><br> 
						As a kid, my interest in outer space and astronomy was insatiable. It started off with my curiosity about aliens & extraterrestrial beings, before slowly falling into absolute awe at size of the universe we lived in, the existence of the objects, and finally, our humble abode we live in called Mother Earth.
						<br><br>
						 I remember in middle school, an astronomer who worked in the CSA came to our school for a little QNA session. During that session, I asked so many questions, participated so much, and was just exuberating at the idea of being able to talk about astronomy this much. 
						<br><br>
						In fact, at the end of the session, a teacher who was supervising was so impressed with my enthusiasm and interest, that she ended up giving me a few posters, a little solar system model and space keychains. They were all technically school supplies, so she had me sneak them out in the backpack. When I asked her why she did it, she told me she wanted to support a young astronaut. (And that they were going to throw those things away. She really didn't like waste.)
						<br><br> 
						I had been presented a chance to mix my skills in computers and programming with my childhood passion of astronomy and space. For me, it was the perfect job.

						I've been lucky enough to have experience with the open market, and developed the skills that employers and universities actively seek for in students and young adults. <br><br> During the summer of 2021, I was working a fast food job at Little Ceasers, making minimum wage. The location was honestly great and I got lucky with how close it was. <br><br> The work was tough and required some elbow grease. My responsibilities ranged from cooking pizza to cleaning the store, to holding signs outside (my fav part). I learnt many endurance, and perseverance. This job taught me the value of money and the amount of effort that goes into earning money. It made me respect my parents that much more. <br><br> The best part imho was the holding signs outside part. For around 30-45 mins, I got to go outside and hold a sign pointing at the road, whilst under a tree. It was so chill, since I'd just listen to music whilst rating the cars going by. Not one time did anyone ever talk to me which was amazing!

					<p>For comp eng in Mr. Breault's class, My group of 5 were tasked with a project of building a Hoverboard by utilising Arduino. <br><br> Fahim helped me with the IR remote code, Monti with the servo code, & Fiaz + Jeeya worked on building the actual model.

					<p class = "big-black-title">Javascript<br> Rock Paper Scissors</p>
					<p> During the beginning of the pandemic (2020), I (14M) delved deep into programming with Javascript. However, I had to learn the language through online resources. Classes were limited and with the new pandemic, I couldn't exactly take courses. However, Sal Khan came to my rescue. <br><br> The RPS game is fully animated by me, with no modules or libraries used. User first has to agree to "terms and conditions" before playing the game. <br> User is given 4 weapons to choose from (rock, paper, scissors, knife). When they choose, an AI is coded to choose one of those 4 weapons randomly. A score counter is set up. <br><br> A feature I really struggled with adding was the hidden gun. On the top right (left?) of the screen, there's up n down arrows that "scroll" the screen down  to reveal a gun that can beat all other weapons. It took me forever to add that feature, especially with how noob I was at coding. <br><br> The game's code is really shit. It's really inefficient and just too long to be viable. But for 14 year old me, it was the most enjoyable project i've worked on. I probably spend like a month making it without giving up. </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title">Cube Collection Program</p>
					<p> For school, we were given an assignment that utilized files and directories. We had to create an application that accepts a collector'ss information about a collectible. <br>The application should manage 3 or 4 bits of data per item. The application should allow the user to perform at least <br>
						2 actions:<br>
						i) enter information for a new item and save it<br>
						ii) your choice of action on the stored information. <br><br>
					What I had done was have the program accept, sorts, and visualizes collectable rubiks cubes. User is given an entry field where they can type enter to enter information about the cube. User can type search to search for a specific rubiks cube using an entered name. Program will then list the list holding the cube. User can type draw, and is prompted to enter dimensions of cube. Program will then open tkinter and draw a 2d version of said cube. <br><br> The programming of the code was not too difficult, until I came to the drawing section. Tkinter did not like me, and it was evident with the problems I was encountering. <br><br> The drawing of the cube itself on a 2d scale by using the size of the cube required some wits. The program would store the size of the cube that the user entered (i.e 3x3) on a text file. I had the program read the first character of the cube size stored fron the text file, then do bunch of complicated maths using that number. User couldn't enter non-cube rubiks cube (i.e 3x4 isn't a rubiks cube), so there was no way the program could draw the wrong 2d cube.  </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title"> Ripley's Aquarium Website </p>
					<p> In 2017, I was in grade 7. I was 12 years old at the time. During my academic year in grade 7, we had a class field trip to Ripelys Aquarium, where I took plenty of shitty pictures and lost $10 (still fucking furious about that). After all was said and done, our teacher gave us this fucking project where we had to make a brochure, advertising Ripleys Aquarium. <br><br>My over-achieveing head ass (jk) decide to make a website basically mimik in the real site. On the site, there's a little table containing entry prices, and a big title. There's a big banner with options like "Contact Us" linking to the real contact info. The site was hosted on Github<br><br> Credit where credit is due, I had tons of help from an online friend named Lucifer/Luci (irl name Ethan). Dude was a uni student studying software engineering, and basically gave me the idea for the website. I made the entire coede myself, but I'd be lying if I say he didn't help me. He basically was a sort of teacher, who led me to solutions regarding coding errors without solving it himself. <br><br> <i>I'm basically adding this because I want to flex that I did website building when I was 12. </i></p>

					<p class = "big-black-title"> This website </p>
					<p>Building this website was definitely something of a challenge for me since I hadn't done web development in a good minute. <br><br> I started this as a summer project. After hearing about others having a personal portfolio website, I thought I should do the same. Initially, I was gonna make it using a website builder. Many of my friends made their sites with those website builders, and they looked great. However, after watching yt vids of ppl rating other portfolio sites, I realized that in order to showcase my technological literacy, I should code it by hand. <br><br> So thats what I did. Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and perhaps something else in the future! All (most) typed up by the very same fingers that type up racial slurs in Instagram DMS (some was copy and pasted icl). I did learn a lot about css & html from this website tho. <br><br> My hopes is that this website can help me land a nice spot in a prestigious university's computer science or engineering program. Perhaps the interviewers will like my hard work. <br> If I get lucky, maybe it'll even help me land a nice 6-figure,high-salary job.</p>

Account cracking is the process of gaining access to personal accounts by using credentials that have been compromised or stolen from other accounts. <br> Let's say that some really professional, china/russia/usa-funded blackhat hackers manage to get access to a database, and leaks a fuck ton of user credentials. What I do is get this list (called combos) from various online forums such as nulled.to, and basically bruteforce them on other platforms. My hopes is that some idiot uses the same email & password combo on another website. <br><br> Using software like OpenBullet, I can spam requests on target web apps. With decent proxies, a config, a VPS, and a little bit of luck, I can get access to other people's netflix premium accounts. <br><br> It took fucking forever for me to get a hit on some websites, but fuck me it was worth it. I got premium disney+, crunchyroll, netflix, got access to people's emails (not gmail that shit is secure) all for free. <br> I didn't even use them. Not once did I need those accounts. I just gave them away to my friends. Went on IG cf story, and asked "Who wants premium netflix for like 2 months" and then just handed them out like a campaigner handing out fliers a week before the election. <br><br> Do I feel guilty for stealing other people's accounts? No, idgaf. It's their fault for not having a secure password, and it's my win getting access to them. I had <b>zero</b> consequences for these actions. If anything, I made my friends love me and adore me for my charitable ways. Sure sounds selfish and self-centered, but at the end of the day, I got free premium accounts and the one accusing me got nothing except an empty wallet and another company raising ur subscriptions even after record profits.  </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title"> LEGO Robot</p>
					<p> During the beginning of high-school, I joined the LEGO robotics club where we built a battle-bot to fight other robots. It had a color-sensor on the front that would do a 180 whenever it detected black. The borders of the arena was black. <br><br> It was made using a LEGO kit which came with motors, tyres, little lego blocks, and a small chip. It was coded with scratch.<br> I was a part of a group of 5 fellow 9th graders, and worked on building the robot itself. I assisted with the motors as well as a portion of the coding. <br><br> Our robot managed to beat some of the older grades, and we ended up coming 3rd place in our school wide competition. Unfortunately, only top 2 could advance onto city wide championships. </p>

					<p class = "big-black-title"> Arduino IoT CETA line-tracking robot</p>
					<p> I was a part of CETA robotics since I joined Satec in grade 9 (2019). <br> CETA robotics is creating robots that do line-tracking using Arduino, IoT chips and more. There are color sensors at the front that detect black and follow it. If the sensor detects white, it does 360s until it detects black. There are two servos that act as motors for the wheels. The chip and breadboard rest on a frame that also holds the big 4 AA battery cells. The wiring was the most dificult part, as it was so difficult to ensure every component was wired correctly. <br><br> This was coded using C++ on Ardunio. We were given a kit with supplies, but at times, they were insufficient and we had to jerry-rig something that could work. The chip was a _______ (name forgot) and programming it was quite simple. <br><br> The IoT chip also supported remote control of the robot. Using MySQL, adafruit, and a some elbow grease, we were able to connect it to the internet and perform basic robot functions whilst not touching the robot.
